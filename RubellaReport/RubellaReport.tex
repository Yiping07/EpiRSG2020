\section{Model}

Let us define a $k$-age group compartmental SIRV model for the infection dynamics of the diseases covered by the MMR vaccine. This model takes the form of a system of four vectorised ordinary differential equations. Each of the $k$ vector entries then corresponds to a given age subgroup with span $m_i, \quad i\in1...k$. Each equation then governs the dynamics what proportion of the subpopulations is susceptible, infected, recovered, or has been vaccinated.

\begin{align*}
&\frac{d\mathbf{s}}{dt} &=&& \mathbf{B} - (\mathbf{V} - \mathbf{D})\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{s}*(\pmb{\beta}(t)\mathbf{C}\mathbf
{i})+\delta_{t_{end}}(t)\mathbf{M}\mathbf{s}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&\frac{d\mathbf{i}}{dt} &=&&\mathbf{s}*(\pmb{\beta}(t)\mathbf{C}\mathbf{i}) - (\mathbf{D}-\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{\gamma})\mathbf{i}+\delta_{t_{end}}(t)\mathbf{M}\mathbf{i}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} &=&& \gamma\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{D}\mathbf{r}+\delta_{t_{end}}(t)\mathbf{M}\mathbf{r}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} &=&& \mathbf{V}\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{D}\mathbf{v} +\delta_{t_{end}}(t)\mathbf{M}\mathbf{v}\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{align*}
$\mathbf{s}*\mathbf{i}\quad\textit{Denotes the elementwise product}$\\
Where:
\begin{align*}
&\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{i}, \mathbf{r} ,\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{R}^k& \quad& \text{k-age group compartment vectors}\\

\end{align*}

  where $\mathbf{M}$ has the structure
\begin{gather*}
\mathbf{M}=\begin{bmatrix}
-m_1^{-1} &      &        &        &    \\
 m_1^{-1} & -m_2^{-1} &        &        &    \\
     &  m_2^{-1} & -m_3^{-1}   &        &    \\
     &      & \ddots & \ddots &    \\
     &      &		 & m_{k-1}^{-1}& 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{gather*}
\section{Data}
Epidemiologic age structured data for Rubella can be obtained from either Health Protection Agency archives \cite{agency_epidemiological_nodate} or from ECDC Atlas of Infectious Diseases \cite{noauthor_surveillance_nodate}.\\
Immunisation is available from the NHS COVER reports \cite{noauthor_childhood_nodate}.\\
As a starting point for \emph{Who Interacts With Who} matrices, the POLYMOD study \cite{mossong_social_2008} can utilised.\\
This data should enable us to parametrise and fit an age stratified SIRV model for years 1998-2019. Adding gender structure should be explored as well in the case of rubella as the primary concern is cogenital rubella syndrome in newborns.
